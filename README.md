Zero-Knowledge Proof for Linked Data

## [ZKP-LD Playground](https://playground.zkp-ld.org)

- **Experimental**: do not use in production
- You can sign and verify JSON-LD document using BBS+ signatures with LD-Proofs
- You can derive and verify zero-knowledge proofs from multiple signed documents, supporting termwise selective disclosure and proof of termwise equality
